[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=RogerioDoCarmo_mirror_app&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=RogerioDoCarmo_mirror_app)
[![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=RogerioDoCarmo_mirror_app&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=RogerioDoCarmo_mirror_app)

A React Native application that uses the front-facing camera to display a real-time mirror view.

The app's functionality is intentionally simple. The focus of this project is **engineering quality**: every decision — from folder structure to CI/CD — follows professional-grade standards that reflect how production mobile applications are built and shipped.

---

## Motivation

This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate mobile development best practices in a public, auditable codebase. It covers the full lifecycle of a mobile app: local development, automated quality gates, and deployment to both the Apple App Store and Google Play.

## Quality Goals

This project enforces measurable quality standards at every stage of development.

### Test-Driven Development

All production code is written following the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle:

1. Write a failing test that describes the expected behaviour
2. Write the minimum code needed to make it pass
3. Refactor without breaking the tests

No implementation file exists without a corresponding test file written first.

### Test Coverage

| Layer              | Tool                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Unit & Integration | Jest 29 + React Native Testing Library |
| Property-based     | fast-check                             |
| Mutation           | Stryker                                |
| End-to-End         | Maestro                                |

**Coverage threshold: 80%** across statements, branches, functions, and lines — enforced on every commit via a pre-commit hook. Commits are rejected if coverage drops below this threshold.

**Mutation score threshold: 60% (break) / 80% (target)** — Stryker verifies that tests are actually sensitive to code changes, not just present.

### Property-Based Testing

Unit tests verify specific examples. Property-based tests verify **invariants** — rules that must hold for _any_ input the generator can produce.

[fast-check](https://fast-check.dev) is used alongside Jest to express these invariants. When a property fails, fast-check automatically shrinks the counterexample to the smallest input that reproduces the failure.

**Invariants tested:**

| Component / Hook | Property                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useCamera`      | `isReady` is always `false` on mount, regardless of permission state              |
| `useCamera`      | `cameraRef.current` is always `null` on mount, regardless of permission state     |
| `useCamera`      | All required return keys are always present, regardless of permission state       |
| `useCamera`      | `permission` always reflects exactly what `useCameraPermissions` returns          |
| `PermissionGate` | `permission=null` always renders the loading indicator and never renders children |
| `PermissionGate` | `granted=true` always renders children for any value of `canAskAgain`             |
| `PermissionGate` | `granted=false` never renders children for any value of `canAskAgain`             |
| `PermissionGate` | `granted=false, canAskAgain=true` always shows the grant button                   |
| `PermissionGate` | `granted=false, canAskAgain=false` always shows the settings message              |

### Static Analysis

| Tool                    | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESLint v9 (flat config) | Linting — typescript-eslint strict rules, react-hooks, testing-library, jest            |
| Prettier                | Consistent formatting across the entire codebase                                        |
| TypeScript strict       | `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitReturns` |

### Git Hooks

Husky runs the following checks on every `git commit`, blocking the commit if any step fails:

1. **lint-staged** — ESLint + Prettier on staged files only
2. **jest --coverage** — full test suite with coverage threshold enforcement

## Architecture

Miroji follows a **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** architecture: source dependencies point
only inward toward a pure domain, and every third-party library (`expo-camera`,
`expo-localization`) is isolated behind a port so it can be swapped by writing a single
adapter. This is a deliberate showcase of SOLID principles, design patterns, and
type-driven domain modeling on an auditable codebase.

**→ See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the dependency diagram, the SOLID/pattern
mapping anchored to real files, and an honest account of the trade-offs.

## Branching Strategy — Git Flow

| Branch      | Purpose                                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready code. Protected. Only receives merges from `release/*` or `hotfix/*`. |
| `develop`   | Integration branch. All feature branches merge here.                                   |
| `feature/*` | One branch per feature or task, branched from `develop`.                               |
| `release/*` | Branched from `develop` when preparing a store release.                                |
| `hotfix/*`  | Branched from `main` for critical production fixes.                                    |

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every pull request into `develop` or `main` triggers the CI workflow:

```
Lint → Typecheck → Unit/Integration Tests → Mutation Tests
```

Pull requests into `main` additionally trigger E2E tests on both platforms.

Pushing to `main` triggers an EAS production build and automatic submission to both stores.
